# This is an answer to 2020 72-hour-DTI-Coding-Challenge that gets me the scholar position in the end. 

It uses the 'The Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF)', which can be accessed in here: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Part-D-Prescriber

The questions can be categorized into two parts:

1. 10 pretty tough questions that entails vectorized data manipulating techniques (This is a must in dealing with this amount of data)
2. One relatively simple dynamic programming question. I remember it needs you to draw all balls randomly from a list without replacement, and you result (or gain) is the absolute difference between the number on the ball you just got and the number on the previous drawn ball. Then you simulate this process for 100000 times to get a stable mean of the results.
